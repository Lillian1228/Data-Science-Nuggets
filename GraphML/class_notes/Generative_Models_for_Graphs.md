### 8.1 Deep Generative Models for Graphs

Graph generation problem: We want to generate realistic graphs, using graph generative models

Step 1: Properties of real-world graphs - A successful graph generative model should fit
these properties

Step 2: Traditional graph generative models - Each come with different assumptions on the graph
formulation process

Step 3: Deep graph generative models - Learn the graph formation process from the data (This lecture!)

#### 8.1.1 ML for Graph Generation

Graph Generation Tasks:
- Task 1: Realistic graph generation
    - Generate graphs that are **similar to a given set of graphs** [Focus of this lecture]

- Task 2: Goal-directed graph generation
    - Generate graphs that **optimize given objectives/constraints** E.g., Drug molecule generation/optimization

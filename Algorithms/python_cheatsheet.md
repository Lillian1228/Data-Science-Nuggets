- In Python loops, continue and pass statements serve different purposes:
  - continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration
  - pass is a placeholder that does nothing
- all() function takes an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, set, dictionary) as its argument and returns True if all elements in the iterable are true. i.e. all(x==1 for x in list)
- using the built-in memo decorator for DP problem:
  - from functools import cache, lru_cache
  - @cache or @lru_cache(None)

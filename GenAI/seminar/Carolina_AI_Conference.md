Real world tasks: Sequential decision-making under uncertainty (RL)

Use Cases:
- Healthcare system to detect sepsis

    Challenges of RL: only delayed reward and noisy (immediate rewards are unobservable)

    Solution: Reward function approximation using Gaussian process. Use inferred rewards as GT instead of the deferred rewards.

    - Aid Physician Decisionmaking: 

        AI models the human decisions and when it is a critical decision, nudge human to carry out the optimal actions.

        Long-Short Term Reward Framework
